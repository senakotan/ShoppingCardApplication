# ðŸ›’ Shopping App Project
Welcome to the Shopping App! This is an e-commerce application built using Java that simulates a basic shopping experience. Users can create accounts, add products to their cart, and purchase items while managing their balance and product limits. It features different types of users, such as Standard and Premium users, with varying product limits and discounts.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
User Types:

Standard User: Has a limited number of products they can purchase.

Premium User: Can purchase more products and gets a higher discount.

Products:

Users can view, add to cart, remove, and purchase products.

Each product has details such as name, price, and category.

Shopping Cart:

Users can manage their cart, view total price (with applicable discounts), and clear the cart.

Balance Management:

Each user has a balance, and the application ensures they have enough funds to make purchases.

Discount System:

Standard users get a 20% discount, while Premium users get a 50% discount on their total purchase.
